            "Explanation": "On release day, readers opened this book expecting pages. Instead they found prompts that responded to their answers. As they annotated, the accompanying app rearranged future chapters, surfacing stories aligned with their fears, their hopes, their resistances.\n\nOne reader, Jun, noticed the questions sharpening around the choices he avoided. The book reflected his pauses, inviting him to re-read sections where his data showed discomfort. He realised the experience wasn’t passive; Reflexia was co-writing his journey.\n\nJun began leaving notes addressed to the future reader he might become. The book stored them, promising to return the letters in a year. “This book is reading me,” he whispered, “so I will teach it what I long to remember.”"

            "Section": "Concept",
            "Explanation": "Reflexia closes the loop between text and reader. Every highlight, hesitation, and annotation informs what unfolds next. In digital form, this can be literal—adaptive narratives responding to input. In print, it lives through journaling, community discussion, and revisiting margins.\n\nAwareness transforms surveillance into dialogue. When you know the book is reading you, you choose what truths to feed it and what reflections to invite."

            "Explanation": "- Studies on self-discrepancy theory highlight the stress created when performed identities diverge from private selves.\n- Mindfulness practices show measurable reductions in stress when individuals create space for unobserved reflection.\n- Anthropological work on liminality documents rituals that allow communities to acknowledge in-between states without shame."

Observe what the book seems to notice about you.\nStep 4. Write a message to your future reader—whether yourself or another—about what you hope they learn from your data.\nStep 5. Schedule a check-in date to reopen the book and continue the conversation."
