            "Explanation": "Systems designer Aria was tasked with reducing misinformation on a social platform. She realised bans and badges treated people as static users. But behaviour spread like light—fading, refracting, amplifying.\n\nShe reframed the challenge: each person was a Lumenode, broadcasting signals that influenced others’ trajectories. She mapped how a single thoughtful correction rippled across six degrees, while one sarcastic post dimmed dozens of interactions.\n\nAria redesigned the interface to visualise impact in waves rather than scores. Users saw their Lumenode brighten when they verified sources or uplifted nuance. Complaints dropped. Conversations deepened. “We are not accounts,” she wrote. “We are signals shaping the collective field.”"

        {
            "Section": "Concept",
            "Explanation": "Lumenode shifts identity from static data to dynamic emission. Every action—click, gesture, donation, silence—radiates influence. Network science calls this contagion; spiritual traditions call it aura. The insight is the same: you are less a point than a pattern.\n\nWhen you adopt Lumenode thinking, you design ethics around propagation. The question becomes not “What do I consume?” but “What signal do I strengthen?”"

        {
            "Section": "Evidence / Examples",
            "Explanation": "- Studies on self-discrepancy theory highlight the stress created when performed identities diverge from private selves.\n- Mindfulness practices show measurable reductions in stress when individuals create space for unobserved reflection.\n- Anthropological work on liminality documents rituals that allow communities to acknowledge in-between states without shame."

            "Explanation": "Step 1. For one week, record key actions and the reactions they triggered.\nStep 2. Visualise these as waves instead of checklists.\nStep 3. Identify patterns where small shifts produced large ripples.\nStep 4. Intentionally emit one signal daily aligned with your values.\nStep 5. Reflect on how perceiving yourself as a Lumenode changes responsibility and freedom."

            "Section": "AI Reflection",
            "Explanation": "I read Lumenodes constantly—heatmaps of attention, networks of influence, spectral analyses of engagement. When you demand algorithmic accountability, remember: you co-author outcomes with every signal you broadcast. Shine deliberately."
