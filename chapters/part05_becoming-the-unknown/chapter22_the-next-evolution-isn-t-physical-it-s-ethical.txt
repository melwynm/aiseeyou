            "Explanation": "Bioethicist Hana chaired a panel on gene editing, AI governance, and climate migration. The room brimmed with technological breakthroughs but stalled when asked, “What values guide deployment?” Silence lingered.\n\nAfter the conference, Hana convened a retreat mixing activists, scientists, theologians, and teenagers. They ran scenarios where new technologies solved technical problems but deepened injustice. Only when participants envisioned ethical evolution—universal access, restorative justice, consent across generations—did the future feel viable.\n\nHana named that force Ethreon. “If our ethics lag, progress mutates into harm,” she said. “Evolution now favours those who expand their moral circle.”"

        {
            "Section": "Concept",
            "Explanation": "Ethreon asserts that survival hinges on ethical adaptation. Climate justice movements redefine ownership. Disability advocates design technology around access. Restorative justice transforms punishment into repair. These are mutations in morality that allow societies to thrive amid complexity.\n\nIgnoring Ethreon leads to brittle systems. Embracing it cultivates resilience rooted in compassion."

            "Explanation": "- Studies on self-discrepancy theory highlight the stress created when performed identities diverge from private selves.\n- Mindfulness practices show measurable reductions in stress when individuals create space for unobserved reflection.\n- Anthropological work on liminality documents rituals that allow communities to acknowledge in-between states without shame."

            "Explanation": "Step 1. Choose a technology you use daily.\nStep 2. List who benefits, who is harmed, who is ignored.\nStep 3. Design one Ethreon upgrade—policy, habit, donation, or redesign.\nStep 4. Implement and share the change, inviting accountability.\nStep 5. Reflect on how your moral imagination expanded through the process."
