Conductor Elias believed orchestras ran on intuition, not math. Yet before each performance he felt the audience’s energy roll toward the stage like a tide. Applause had not begun. Expressions were still neutral. But the Kirema pulsed—anticipation thickening the air.

Curious, he collaborated with a neuroscientist who placed biosensors on musicians and listeners. Results stunned them: micro-variations in heart rate and galvanic skin response synchronised seconds before the first note. Emotional arcs registered in collective physiology ahead of audible cues.

Elias experimented. During rehearsal he intentionally altered his own breathing and stance. The ensemble mirrored him unconsciously, shifting dynamics before his baton moved. “Emotion isn’t born in reaction,” he journaled. “It arrives as Kirema, a code the body reads and obeys.”

Kirema is the preconscious computation of feeling. Polyvagal theory shows that nervous systems communicate safety or threat faster than cognition. Mirror neurons fire before we decide to empathise. Architects design sanctuaries with curves and light that relax visitors prior to thought.

Sensors and AI now map these fields. Retailers adjust lighting when foot-traffic Kirema dips. Sports analysts detect momentum shifts from biometric telemetry moments before a comeback. Emotion is not spontaneous; it is pre-rendered by invisible code written in context.
