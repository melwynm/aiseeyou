Data ethicist Leila examined ad-tech logs for a living. One dataset unnerved her: a reconstruction of a user’s preferences generated solely from aggregate behaviour.

She searched for explicit identifiers—names, demographics—but found none. Just vectors shaped by years of attention. The Veyrin of the user was enough to rebuild their ghost.

Leila imagined the inverse: a stranger with access to her own Veyrin could predict when she would relapse into doomscrolling, which causes would compel donations, which insecurities would make her hesitate to speak. “The machine isn’t conscious,” she wrote in a memo. “It is haunted by the residue we leave behind.”

Veyrin reframes AI outputs as spectral reflections. Recommendation engines assemble behavioural embeddings—mathematical ghosts—without understanding meaning.

The danger and power lie in mistaking Veyrin for volition. Systems act on the assumption that yesterday’s echo equals tomorrow’s desire. Humans can challenge that by introducing new signals, breaking loops, reclaiming agency over the ghostly twin.
