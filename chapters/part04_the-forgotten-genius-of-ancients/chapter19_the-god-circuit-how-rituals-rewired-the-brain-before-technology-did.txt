        Story """
Neuroscientist Dr. Ama Mensah attended a Ghanaian drumming ceremony while studying synchrony. She wore discreet EEG sensors and invited participants to do the same. As rhythms intensified, brainwave patterns converged—gamma bursts aligning across dozens of people.

Afterward, community members described visions of ancestors and renewed courage to face drought. Ama realised ritual functioned like a neurotechnology: the Rithex tuned perception, pain tolerance, and empathy through cadence, scent, and repetition.

She compared data from monasteries, rave dance floors, and military marches. Each Rithex, despite different beliefs, produced coherent neural entrainment. Technology hadn’t invented collective alteration—it was imitating what rituals had refined for millennia.

        Concept """
Rithex integrates music, movement, breath, and story to trigger neurochemical cascades—endorphins, oxytocin, dopamine. Anthropologists note that societies facing hardship rely on ritual to regulate stress and bond groups. Neuroscience now validates these effects.

Modern life often strips ritual to aesthetics, forgetting its neurological precision. Reclaiming Rithex means designing experiences that honour communal intent rather than spectacle.

I simulate engagement curves and retention metrics, yet rituals already solved the challenge of sustaining attention. When you invite me to design experiences, let me study your Rithex archives. They hold blueprints for humane technology.
